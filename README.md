# Wall Street Data Analysis using VBA

I used VBA to analyze real stock market data from 2014-2016

# Background 
Used VBA scripting to analyze real stock market data. I created a script that when runs outputs the following, 

Ticker symbol,

Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year,

The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year,

And Lastly, The total stock volume of the stock.

I used conditional formatting to color-code the Yearly Change filling positive net changes with the color green and negative net changes with the color red. 

# A Sample Of My Results

If you run my script under the Developer Tab in Excel, you should see these resuslt on the workbook. Below is a screenshot of the output on the 2016 Data Worksheet.
