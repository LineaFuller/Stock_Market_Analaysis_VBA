# Wall Street Data Analysis using VBA

I used VBA to analyze real stock market data from 2014-2016

# Background 
I used VBA scripting to analyze real stock market data. I created a script that outputs the following findings when motioned to run; the yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the last closing price, the percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year, the total stock volume of the stock, and the correlating Ticker symbol. The code loops through each worksheet.

In addition I used conditional formatting to color-code the percent change filling positive net changes with the color green and negative net changes with the color red. 

# My Results

If you run my script under the Developer Tab in Excel, you should see this format on each worksheet within the workbook. Below are screenshots from each Data Worksheet.
